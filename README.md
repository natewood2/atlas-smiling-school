# README: Implement a design with bootstrap

## Introduction
This README over Bootstrap will explain what Bootstrap is. How I used it and why it is useful.


## Bootstrap

Bootstrap is a powerful, open-source front-end framework used for designing and developing responsive, mobile-first websites and web applications. Developed by Twitter, it includes a collection of CSS and JavaScript tools that help streamline the web development process.

## Recreating SmileSchool

SmileSchool is a website that we are giving in the form of a Figma file and tasked with recreating it. Creating with as little CSS as possible, which makes it difficult. Though I have found Bootstrap useful.

There was a lot that fast and easy to use and some other stuff now.


## Prebuilt Bootstrap Components

We used a Bootstrap carousel for the video section which make the videos alternate screens.

We used a prebuilt hamburger menu for the drop down menu when the screen is resized.

We all used all the reactiveness of Bootstrap on the entire page, which was very helpful.
