# README: Implement a design with bootstrap

## Introduction
This README will guide you through the process of creating a website using Bootstrap to implement a design onto a webpage. Bootstrap simplifies the process by providing a responsive grid system, pre-styled components, and utility classes, which significantly reduce the amount of custom CSS you need to write.

## Prerequisites
- Basic knowledge of HTML and CSS
- Familiarity with Bootstrap (optional, but helpful)

## Bootstrap

Bootstrap is a powerful, open-source front-end framework used for designing and developing responsive, mobile-first websites and web applications. Developed by Twitter, it includes a collection of CSS and JavaScript tools that help streamline the web development process.

## Recreating SmileSchool

SmileSchool is a website that we are giving in the form of a Figma file and tasked with recreating it. Creating with as little CSS as possible, which makes it difficult. Though I have found Bootstrap useful.
